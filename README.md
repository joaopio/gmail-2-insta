# gmail-2-insta

This application checks for emails in a Gmail account which have a predefined subject, downloads its attachments and posts them to a predefined Instagram account.

I came up with the concept when trying to create a live social wall for my wedding. I realized that not everyone has Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, yet everyone can send an email.
The Instagram account can then be monitored by a third party live social wall service and the results shown during the event.
